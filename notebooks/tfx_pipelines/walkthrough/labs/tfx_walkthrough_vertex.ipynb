    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Develop a high level understanding of TFX pipeline components.\n",
    "2.  Learn how to use a TFX Interactive Context for prototype development of TFX pipelines.\n",
    "3.  Work with the Tensorflow Data Validation (TFDV) library to check and analyze input data.\n",
    "4.  Utilize the Tensorflow Transform (TFT) library for scalable data preprocessing and feature transformations.\n",
    "5.  Employ the Tensorflow Model Analysis (TFMA) library for model evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you will work with the [Covertype Data Set](https://github.com/jarokaz/mlops-labs/blob/master/datasets/covertype/README.md) and use TFX to analyze, understand, and pre-process the dataset and train, analyze, validate, and deploy a multi-class classification model to predict the type of forest cover from cartographic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will utilize  **TFX Interactive Context** to work with the TFX components interactivelly in a Jupyter notebook environment. Working in an interactive notebook is useful when doing initial data exploration, experimenting with models, and designing ML pipelines. You should be aware that there are differences in the way interactive notebooks are orchestrated, and how they access metadata artifacts. In a production deployment of TFX on GCP, you will use an orchestrator such as Kubeflow Pipelines, or Cloud Composer. In an interactive mode, the notebook itself is the orchestrator, running each TFX component as you execute the notebook cells. In a production deployment, ML Metadata will be managed in a scalabe database like MySQL, and artifacts in apersistent store such as Google Cloud Storage. In an interactive mode, both properties and payloads are stored in a local file system of the Jupyter host.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Setup Note:**\n",
    "Currently, TFMA visualizations do not render properly in JupyterLab. It is recommended to run this notebook in Jupyter Classic Notebook. To switch to Classic Notebook select *Launch Classic Notebook* from the *Help* menu."

    "Some TFX components use a description input data called a schema. The schema is an instance of `schema.proto`. It can specify data types for feature values, whether a feature has to be present in all examples, allowed value ranges, and other properties. `SchemaGen` automatically generates the schema by inferring types, categories, and ranges from data statistics. The auto-generated schema is best-effort and only tries to infer basic properties of the data. It is expected that developers review and modify it as needed. `SchemaGen` uses [TensorFlow Data Validation](https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/data_validation/get_started).\n",

The emitted `SavedModel`  can then be used by serving components to make sure that the same data pre-processing logic is applied at training and serving.\n",

This module will be loaded by transform and the `preprocessing_fn` function will be called when the `Transform` component runs.\n",

    "This concludes your introductory walthrough through TFX pipeline components. In the lab, you used TFX to analyze, understand, and pre-process the dataset and train, analyze, validate, and deploy a multi-class classification model to predict the type of forest cover from cartographic features. You utilized a TFX Interactive Context for prototype development of a TFX pipeline directly in a Jupyter notebook. Next, you worked with the TFDV library to modify your dataset schema to add feature constraints to catch data anamolies that can negatively impact your model's performance. You utilized TFT library for feature proprocessing for consistent feature transformations for your model at training and serving time. Lastly, using the TFMA library, you added model performance constraints to ensure you only push more accurate models than previous runs to production."
